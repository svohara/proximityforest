Description

A proximity forest is a data structure that allows for efficient computation of approximate nearest neighbors of arbitrary data elements in a metric space.

See: O'Hara and Draper, "Are You Using the Right Approximate Nearest Neighbor Algorithm?", WACV 2013 (best student paper award).

One application of a ProximityForest is given in the following CVPR publication:
Stephen O'Hara and Bruce A. Draper, "Scalable Action Recognition with a Subspace Forest," IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2012.
